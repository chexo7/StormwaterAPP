# Processing Checklist

1. Verify the LOD layer contains a single polygon.
2. Clip the Drainage Areas layer using the LOD polygon and save the result as **Drainage Area in LOD**. The new shapefile must preserve all attributes from the original Drainage Areas layer while adopting the LOD boundaries.

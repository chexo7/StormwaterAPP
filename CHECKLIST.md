# Data Processing Checklist

1. Verify that the LOD layer contains only a single polygon.
2. Use this LOD polygon to clip the Drainage Areas layer. Save the result as a new shapefile named **Drainage Area in LOD**. This new shapefile must retain all attributes of the original Drainage Areas layer while using the LOD boundaries.
